## Abstract

This ERC introduces an access control scheme termed Token-Controlled Token Circulation (TCTC). By representing the privileges associated with a role as an [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) token (referred to as a `control token`), the processes of granting or revoking a role can be facilitated through the minting or burning of the corresponding `control token`. 
  
## Motivation

There are numerous methods to implement access control for privileged actions. A commonly utilized pattern is "role-based" access control as specified in [ERC-5982](./eip-5982.md). This method, however, necessitates the use of an off-chain management tool to grant or revoke required roles through its interface. Additionally, as many wallets lack a user interface that displays the privileges granted by a role, users are often unable to comprehend the status of their privileges through the wallet.

### Use Cases

This ERC is applicable in many scenarios where role-based access control as described in [ERC-5982](./eip-5982.md) is used. Specific use cases include:

**Mint/Burn Permission:**
In applications that circulate items such as tickets, coupons, membership cards, and site access rights as tokens, it is necessary to provide the system administrator with the authority to mint or burn these tokens. These permissions can be realized as `control tokens` in this scheme.

**Transfer Permission:**
In some situations within these applications, it may be desirable to limit the ability to transfer tokens to specific agencies. In these cases, an agency certificate is issued as a `control token`. The ownership of this `control token` then provides the means to regulate token transfers.

**Address Verification:**
Many applications require address verification to prevent errors in the recipient's address when minting or transferring target tokens. A `control token` is issued as proof of address verification to users, which is required by the recipient when a mint or transfer transaction is executed, thus preventing misdeliveries. In some instances, this `control token` for address verification may be issued by a government agency or specific company after an identity verification process.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

1. Smart contracts implementing the [ERC-5982](./eip-5982.md) (this ERC) standard MUST represent the privilege required by the role as an ERC-721 token. The tokens that represent privileges are called `control tokens` in this ERC. The `control token` can be any type of token, and its transactions may be recursively controlled by another `control token`.
2. To associate the required `control token` with the role, the address of the previously deployed contract for the `control token` MUST be used.
3. To ascertain whether an account possesses the necessary role, it SHOULD be confirmed that the balance of the `control token` exceeds 0, utilizing the `balanceOf` method defined in ERC-721.
4. To grant a role to an account, a `control token` representing the privilege SHOULD be minted to the account using `safeMint` method defined in [ERC-5679](./eip-5679.md).
5. To revoke a role from an account, the `control token` representing the privilege SHOULD be burned using the `burn` method defined in ERC-5679.
6. A role in a compliant smart contract is represented in the format of `bytes32`. It's RECOMMENDED the value of such role is computed as a `keccak256` hash of a string of the role name, in this format: `bytes32 role = keccak256("<role_name>")`. such as `bytes32 role = keccak256("MINTER")`.
  
## Rationale

TBD

## Backwards Compatibility

This ERC is designed to be compatible for ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-5679 respectively.

## Reference Implementation

The following presents a straightforward example of a contract that implements a modifier. This modifier checks if an account possesses the necessary role, and the contract includes a function that grants a specific role to a designated account.

pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract TokenController {
    mapping (bytes32 => address []) private _controlTokens;

    modifier onlyHasToken(bytes32 r, address u) {
        require(_checkHasToken(r,u), "TokenController: not has a required token");
        _;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Grant a role to user who owns a control token specified by the contract ID. 
     * Multiple calls are allowed, in this case the user must own at least one of the 
     * specified token.
     * @param r byte32 The role which you want to grant.
     * @param c address The address of contract ID of which token the user required to own.
     */
    function _grantRoleByToken (bytes32 r, address c) internal {
        _controlTokens[r].push(c);
    }

    function _checkHasToken (bytes32 r, address u) internal view returns (bool) {
        for (uint i = 0; i < _controlTokens[r].length; i++) {
            if (IERC721(_controlTokens[r][i]).balanceOf(u) > 0) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

The following is a simple example of utilizing `TokenController` within an ERC721 token to define "minter" and "burner" roles. Accounts possessing these roles are allowed to create new tokens and destroy existing tokens, facilitated by specifying the control token:

import "./TokenController.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC721, TokenController {
    bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");
    bytes32 public constant BURNER_ROLE = keccak256("HOLDER_ROLE");

    constructor() ERC721("MyToken", "MTK") {
        _grantRoleByToken(MINTER_ROLE, 0x...);
        _grantRoleByToken(BURNER_ROLE, 0x...);
    }

    function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId)
        public onlyHasToken(MINTER_ROLE, msg.sender)
    {
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
    }

    function burn(uint256 tokenId)
        public onlyHasToken(BURNER_ROLE, msg.sender)
    {
        _burn(tokenId);
    }
}
```
